# PyPSA meets Earth website

The "PyPSA meets Earth" website can be used as template for your own purpose. The html code is located in the `index.html` and the css (styling of website) is located in `assets/css`.

To use the website, it is worth to investigate the following features that we build in:
- Bootstrap template:
    Template Name: Bocor, 
    Template URL: https://bootstrapmade.com/bocor-bootstrap-template-nice-animation/,
    Author: BootstrapMade.com
- TSparticles: https://particles.js.org/ for the Africa particle map
- Google forms for the newsletter
- Flickr for some pictures 
- Logomakr for vector logos

As code environment, we had code experience using VScode and the "Live Server" add-on.
