# Are you a Modeler or Researcher?

If you are a developer or researcher, the best way to support us is to get actively involved. We can offer you to follow, join and lead activities that are sustainable and make impact around the world. You will benefit from our network, our existing development experience and regular open exchanges.

Here you can introduce yourself, your interest and your goals. We are happy to guide you from there. It's perfectly possible to combine research work with development of an open-source project. Just have a look at [PyPSA publications list](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/talks_and_papers.html#id3).
